    `Hello ${name}, thx for coming by that fast. My grandchild Elenora has her 5th birthday tomorrow and I want to buy her a fluffy pet as present but I completely forgot what her favorite animal is. Maybe you can find some clues in my house. As shops close in three hours I'll head out immediatelly. Just get in, feel like home and write me if you found it out. The room query is already implemented, there is only a small piece missing.`,
