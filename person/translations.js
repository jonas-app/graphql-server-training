      `Hello ${name}, thx for coming by that fast. — My grandchild Elenora 🧒🏼 has her 5th birthday tomorrow and I want to buy her a fluffy pet as present but I completely forgot what her favorite animal is. Maybe you can find some clues in my house, there are a lot of things in the room which might help. — I'm a bit in a hurry as my gymnastic session starts soon - yes, I'm 94 👵🏼 and do professional gymnastic. Take a look: https://youtu.be/iKDrOWdxLQo?t=101 🏅 Just get in, feel like home and write me a sticky note if you found it out. The room query is already implemented, there is only a small piece missing.`,
